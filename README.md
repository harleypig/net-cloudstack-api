## How did I do this?

* Get a basic cloudstack dev environment working. Follow instructions found
  [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/How+to+build+CloudStack).

    Using the information on
    [this](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/How+To+Generate+CloudStack+API+Documentation)
    page, and a lot of experimentation, I was able to find something that
    worked well enough.

* Make sure your paths match the following structure.

    $HOME

      projects

          cloudstack

              cloudstack.orig (original cloudstack git clone)

          net-cloudstack-api
